conventional "nvidia-smi" is not working on Tegra. But "tegrastats" provides you with similar info includes RAM, BUFFER, CPU, EMC, AVP, VDE, and GR3D:

sudo ./tegrastats

You have four CPUs on Jetson TK1 so you see cpu [51%, 96%, off, off] which provides the CPU usage.
GR3D explors the persentage usage and instance GPU frequency, for instance, 64%@324

or you have an option to check the log file as well:

cat /sys/devices/platform/host1x/gk20a.0/load

or monitor it persistently, for instance every 1s, by:

watch -n 1 cat /sys/devices/platform/host1x/gk20a.0/load
